# eComparatio
The software development starts at the point of the question, if we could achive a extreamly accurate alignment of a text diff. Maybe in a synoptical represntation. It turned out that most text diff algorithims are not capabal of putting out results of that strangth. We wanted a output that could be uses as a starting point to enhancing the ideas of digital edition. We wanted something that lets the user focus on the text and to be aware of diffeneces and their clustering among the basetext, we wanted a traditional representation that could be found in scientific editions, for example a apparatus variantes (but with the space and interactive benefits of the screen live), we wanted a synoptical representation, straigt alighned word by word. After we were able of building a comparison program (text diff, differntial text analysis etc. etc.), that was able of suppling the needed results, we find out that comparing is much harder than expected. We started to add classes of reasons for the diff, the programm has found (this classes are: ganzer Unterschied, Unterschied d. Gr.- und Kl.schreibung, Unterschied d. diakritischen Zeichen, Ligatur Unterschied, Umbruch Unterschied, Unterschied d. Interpunktion, Unterschied d. ZÃ¤hlung, Mehr als im anderen Text, Weniger als im anderen Text, Klammerung unterschiedlich, lateinisches U und V, Vertauschung Verdrehung, Verdrehung von Passagen, Mehr im Referenztext, einzelner Buchstabe, wenige Buchstaben anders, Trennung). To evalutae all this classes, and to generate all needed results, we were forced to give up most of the speed comming out of the efficent algorithems, moreover we were forced to evaluate possible errors, to align the most probabal text postitions, taht means we added a opimization like part to the software.

# Who is Who
The program evolved from projects concerning digital editions at the University Leipzig, Chair of ancient history. It reached a development state that can be seen as stable software version. The development
